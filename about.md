Hello! I am a(n):

- Student @OSU
- Full stack dev [@Taivara](http://www.taivara.com)
- Obscenely proud father @AllTimes
- Hacker @Heart

Through working with engineer's smarter than I, I've come to believe that the
following two traits make good developers great: thoughtfulness and confidence.
I am by no means a shining embodiment of either; I do, however, deliberately
work towards each everyday.

Currently seeking a summer internship or full-time postition in
software development on the web.
