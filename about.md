Hello! I am a(n):

- Full stack dev [@Taivara](http://www.taivara.com)
- Obscenely proud father @AllTimes
- Hacker @Heart

Through working with engineers smarter than I, I've come to believe that the
following two traits make good developers great: thoughtfulness and confidence.
I am by no means a shining embodiment of either; I do, however, deliberately
work towards each everyday.

Currently happily employed at Taivara, a software commercialization studio, in
Columbus, OH.
